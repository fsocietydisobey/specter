        "Prerequisite: Chromium running with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`.\n\n"
        "# CRITICAL DEBUGGING RULES — read these before every tool call\n\n"
        "1. **NEVER GUESS at data shapes, props, or field names.** Always inspect "
        "actual runtime data first. Example: `evaluate_js(\"console.log(JSON."
        "stringify(myVar))\")` → `get_console_logs()`. 10 seconds of inspection "
        "saves 10 minutes of wrong guesses.\n\n"
        "2. **Always check console and errors BEFORE trying to fix anything.** "
        "`get_console_logs(level='error')` + `get_errors()` — the answer is "
        "usually already in a stack trace pointing to the exact line.\n\n"
        "3. **Wrong data after an API call? Check the network, not the component.** "
        "`get_network_log(url_filter='/api/v1/...')` shows what the API actually "
        "returned. If status is 200 but data is wrong, the bug is in the response "
        "transformation — not the component.\n\n"
        "4. **Start with `debug_snapshot()`.** One call returns screenshot + page "
        "info + console errors + network errors + page structure. Use this first; "
        "call individual tools only to drill into specifics.\n\n"
        "5. **Prefer clicking over URL navigation for in-app flows.** The "
        "app's router controls state — clicking a link via `click_element` "
        "exercises the same code path a real user hits and preserves state. "
        "For deep-linking or skipping a multi-step flow, use "
        "`router_navigate(path)` (soft, tries link-click first then "
        "`location.href`). Use `navigate_to(url)` only for cross-origin "
        "navigation or deliberate full-page resets. **Next.js caveat:** App "
        "Router can strip query params on programmatic navigation; if query "
        "state matters, click the link instead. Always follow any navigation "
        "with `wait_for_network_idle()` before the next interaction.\n\n"
        "6. **Don't fight with navigation to debug.** If you need to see data, use "
        "`evaluate_js` to inspect it directly — don't navigate to a different page "
        "hoping to see it visually. Screenshots are for visuals; data goes through "
        "`get_component_at` / `get_redux_state` / `evaluate_js`.\n\n"
        "# When to use Specter\n\n"
        "- Frontend bugs where the error is in the browser, not the code (wrong "
        "props, stale state, failed API calls)\n"
        "- Visual debugging — \"does this look right?\" → take a screenshot\n"
        "- Tracing data flow — API response → Redux state → component props → "
        "rendered DOM\n"
        "- Interaction testing — click through a flow without the user doing it\n\n"
        "# Debugging workflow (8 steps)\n\n"
        "0. **Connect to the right tab**: `list_tabs()` → `connect_to_tab(id)`. "
        "Pick the app tab — NOT `pipeline-tracer.html`, NOT `devtools://` URLs.\n"
        "1. **See**: `take_screenshot` to capture visual state.\n"
        "2. **Check errors**: `get_console_logs(level='error')` + `get_errors`.\n"
        "3. **Check network**: `get_network_errors` for failed API calls.\n"
        "4. **Inspect React**: `check_react` then `get_component_at(selector)`.\n"
        "5. **Inspect state**: `get_redux_state(path)` — don't walk the store "
        "manually via `evaluate_js`; this helper handles fiber walking correctly.\n"
        "6. **Interact**: `get_interactive_elements` to find targets, then "
        "`click_element` / `fill_input` / `select_option`.\n"
        "7. **Wait**: `wait_for_network_idle()` after any navigation-triggering "
        "action, else you'll screenshot a loading spinner.\n"
        "8. **Verify**: `take_screenshot` again.\n\n"
        "# Effective patterns\n\n"
        "- **Hover before looking for action buttons.** Table row actions, edit "
        "icons, and dropdown triggers often only render on hover. If "
        "`get_interactive_elements` doesn't show what you expect, "
        "`hover_element` on the parent first, then re-query.\n"
        "- **Keyboard for custom dropdowns.** Non-`<select>` dropdowns usually "
        "need: click to open → `press_key('ArrowDown')` to navigate → "
        "`press_key('Enter')` to select.\n"
        "- **`press_key` for form completion.** `Enter` to submit, `Escape` to "
        "close modals, `Tab` between fields.\n"
        "- **Diagnostic logs via `evaluate_js`.** To trace a runtime function, "
        "inject temporary `console.log` via monkey-patch; read back with "
        "`get_console_logs`. Faster than editing source + reloading.\n"
        "- **Busy pages: use `get_interactive_elements_grouped`.** Returns a "
        "tree of landmarks → components → elements instead of a flat list of "
        "hundreds. Also: `get_interactive_elements` now includes React fiber-"
        "based discovery, so `<div onClick>` patterns with no ARIA markers "
        "show up with `discoveredVia: 'react'` and the handler names.\n"
        "- **Scroll before screenshotting/clicking.** If a target is below the "
        "fold use `scroll_to_element(selector)`. For scrollable panels, "
        "virtualized lists, or modals with internal overflow, use "
        "`scroll_within(scroller_selector, direction, count)` — check `atEnd` "
        "in the response to stop when you hit the edge.\n\n"
        "# Anti-patterns — DON'T\n\n"
        "- **Don't use `evaluate_js` for Redux state.** Use `get_redux_state(path)` "
        "— it handles multi-renderer fiber walking, store caching, safe "
        "serialization. Manual `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__` walks are the #1 "
        "wasted pattern.\n"
        "- **Don't filter duplicate DOM matches manually.** When "
        "`querySelectorAll` returns more elements than expected, use "
        "`get_elements_grouped_by_component(selector)` — groups by owning React "
        "component so you can see which view each match came from.\n"
        "- **Don't screenshot to verify data.** For \"does this have the right "
        "data?\", use `get_component_at` or `evaluate_js`. Pixels lie; props "
        "don't.\n"
        "- **Don't skip console logs.** Error stack traces point at exact lines — "
        "worth more than any amount of code-reading."

    Uses CDP Page.navigate — equivalent to typing the URL in the address bar.
    Triggers a full page load, resets all in-memory app state, and re-runs
    every bootstrap effect. Use sparingly.

    Prefer `click_element` on a link for intra-app navigation — that uses the
    app's own router and keeps state. Use this tool when:
      - You need to land on an absolute URL that isn't linked from the
        current page.
      - You want to explicitly reset app state (log out, clear a broken
        client cache, start a session fresh).
      - You're navigating to a DIFFERENT origin.

    Caveat: for Next.js App Router apps, programmatic navigation can strip
    query params in some flows. If query state matters, prefer
    `router_navigate` or `click_element`.

    Softer alternative to `navigate_to`. Tries in order:
      1. Click an existing `<a href>` link that matches the target path
         (most reliable for Next.js — uses the app's Link behavior).
      2. Fall back to `window.location.href = path` for same-origin paths,
         which most SPA routers intercept as soft transitions.

    Keeps app state (Redux, React context, Zustand, etc.) when the app's
    router handles the transition. The link-click path is preferred because
    it exercises the same code path as a real user click.

    Use this when:
      - You want to deep-link to a URL without breaking app state.
      - There's no visible link to click (e.g., the target only renders
        after a multi-step flow you'd rather skip).

    Known caveats:
      - Next.js App Router may strip query params on some `location.href`
        transitions. If that bites you, `click_element` the link directly.
      - After navigating, call `wait_for_network_idle()` before the next
        interaction — the new route's data fetches are in flight.
